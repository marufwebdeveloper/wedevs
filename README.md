Description

- Features

Installation
-------------

There are two ways by which you can install the scripts.

- Clone the git repo to your local machine and then add the path to the repo to your `PATH` variable (or)
- Execute the following commands in your terminal

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/marufwebdeveloper/wedevs
chmod +x ./wedevs/*.sh
mv ./wedevs/*.sh /usr/local/bin/
rm -r ./wedevs
```

Usage
-------------

### Cloning existing Plugins from SVN into github

You can use the `clone-from-svn-to-git.sh` script to clone an existing Plugin from the official WordPress repository SVN into github.

`.path/to/clone-from-svn-to-git.sh [-p plugin-name] [-a authors-file] [-u svn-username] [-g github-repo-url]`

The following are the different options that you can pass to this script.

- `-p` - The name of the Plugin
- `-a` - The path to the authors file. You can find a sample authors file in the root directory of the repo.
- `-u` - The svn username. It is same as your WordPress Plugin repo username.
- `-g` - The url to the github repo. You should have push rights to this repo.

### Deploying to SVN repo from Github

You can use the `deploy-plugin.sh` script to deploy your Plugins to SVN repo, from a git repo.

You don't need to have a copy of this script in every repo. You just need to have one copy of this script somewhere and then you can invoke it from multiple Plugin directories using the following options.

```
./path/to/deploy-plugin.sh [-p plugin-name] [-u svn-username] [-m main-plugin-file]
        [-a assets-dir-name] [-t tmp directory] [-i make-pot-command] [-h history/changelog file]
        [-r] [-b build-command]
```

The following are the different options that you can pass to this script.

- `-p` - The name of the Plugin. The script can pick it up from the current directory name
- `-u` - The svn username. It is same as your WordPress Plugin repo username.
- `-m` - The name of the main Plugin file. By default, it is `plugin-name.php`
- `-a` - The name of the Plugin's assets directory. By default, it is assumed to be `assets-wp-repo`
- `-t` - Path to the temporary directory. By default `/tmp` is used
- `-i` - Command to generate pot file.
- `-h` - The name of the History or changelog file. By default `HISTORY.md` is used.
- `-r` - Whether build command should be run. By default `npm run dist` is called.
- `-b` - Override build command. This command should place the final files in `/dist` directory.

### Convert readme file from md to txt format and vice versa

You can use the `readme-converter.sh` script to convert the readme file between WordPress Plugin format and github markdown format. This script also handles screenshots as well.

The `deploy-script.sh` script automatically does the conversion by using this script.

`./path/to/readme-converter.sh [from-file] [to-file] [format to-wp|from-wp]`

The following are the different options that you can pass to this script.

- The first parameter is the path to the input file
- The second parameter is the path to the output file
- The third parameter specifies the format. You can use one of the following two.
    - `to-wp` - convert from Github markdown format to WordPress Plugin Readme format
    - `from-wp` - convert from WordPress Plugin Readme format to Github markdown format

### Creating a zip archive of the Plugin

You can use the `create-archive.sh` script to quickly create a zip archive of the Plugin.

`./path/to/create-archive.sh [-p plugin-name] [-o output-dir]`

The following are the different options that you can pass to this script.

- `-p` - The name of the Plugin. The script can pick it up from the current directory name
- `-o` - Path to the output directory, where the zip file should be created

### Update version string of the Plugin

You can use the `update-version.sh` script to quickly update the version string of all the files of the Plugin.

`./path/to/update-version.sh [old_version] [new_version]`

The following are the different options that you can pass to this script.

- `old_version` - Old version string. This string should be escaped. eg: 1\.2\.3 and not 1.2.3
- `new_version` - New version string. You don't have to escape this

Code Quality Status
-------------------

The code is pretty stable and I currently use these script for deploying my [WordPress Plugins](http://sudarmuthu.com/wordpress) without any major issues. I would however consider the code to be of beta quality status.
